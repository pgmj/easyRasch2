# Partial Gamma Local Dependence Analysis

Computes partial gamma coefficients for Local Dependence (LD) assessment
using
[`iarm::partgam_LD()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/iarm/man/partgam_LD.html).
Each pair of items is tested for residual association, controlling for
the rest score (total score minus one of the items in the pair).

## Usage

``` r
RMlocdepGamma(
  data,
  cutoff = NULL,
  p_value = FALSE,
  correction = c("fwer", "fdr_bh", "fdr_by", "none"),
  alpha = 0.05,
  output = "kable",
  n_pairs = NULL
)
```

## Arguments

- data:

  A data.frame or matrix of item responses. Items must be scored
  starting at 0 (non-negative integers). Missing values (`NA`) are
  allowed, but at least one complete case must exist.

- cutoff:

  Optional. Default `NULL` (no cutoff applied). Can be:

  - The return value of
    [`RMlocdepGammaCutoff`](https://pgmj.github.io/easyRasch2/dev/reference/RMlocdepGammaCutoff.md)
    (a list with `$pair_cutoffs`): the data.frame is extracted
    automatically and simulation metadata is included in the kable
    caption.

  - The `$pair_cutoffs` data.frame from
    [`RMlocdepGammaCutoff`](https://pgmj.github.io/easyRasch2/dev/reference/RMlocdepGammaCutoff.md)
    directly: must have columns `Item1`, `Item2`, `gamma_low`,
    `gamma_high`. When provided, adds columns `Gamma_low`, `Gamma_high`,
    and `Flagged` (logical; `TRUE` when the observed partial gamma falls
    outside the credible range) to the result.

- p_value:

  Logical. When `TRUE`, adds one-sided bootstrap p-values for *excess
  positive* local dependence (`p_gamma`, `padj_gamma`), matching the
  `p_value` semantics of
  [`RMlocdepQ3`](https://pgmj.github.io/easyRasch2/dev/reference/RMlocdepQ3.md),
  and `flagged` reflects `padj_gamma < alpha` (positive deviations only)
  instead of the credible range. One test per item pair: the p-value is
  computed in the canonical direction (direction 1, rest score = total -
  Item2, the direction that was simulated) and repeated in the
  direction-2 table for the same pair. The asymptotic BH-adjusted
  p-value and star columns from
  [`iarm::partgam_LD()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/iarm/man/partgam_LD.html)
  are **dropped** in this mode; the simulated `gamma_low` / `gamma_high`
  band is kept as the effect-size reference. Requires the **full**
  [`RMlocdepGammaCutoff`](https://pgmj.github.io/easyRasch2/dev/reference/RMlocdepGammaCutoff.md)
  object as `cutoff` (it carries the simulated distributions in
  `$results`). Default `FALSE`.

- correction:

  Character. Multiplicity correction for the bootstrap p-values, applied
  over the family of all item pairs (before any `n_pairs` display
  filter): `"fwer"` (default; Westfall-Young studentised-max step-down),
  `"fdr_bh"`, `"fdr_by"`, or `"none"`. Ignored when `p_value = FALSE`.

- alpha:

  Numeric in (0, 1). Significance level used to flag pairs on the
  corrected p-value. Default `0.05`. Ignored when `p_value = FALSE`.

- output:

  Character string controlling the return value. Either `"kable"`
  (default) for a formatted
  [`knitr::kable()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/knitr/man/kable.html) table, or
  `"dataframe"` for the underlying data.frame.

- n_pairs:

  Optional positive integer. When supplied, only the `n_pairs` item
  pairs with the largest absolute partial-gamma values (i.e., strongest
  residual dependence in either direction) are retained per rest-score
  direction, sorted by `|gamma|` descending. When `NULL` (default), all
  pairs are returned in `iarm`'s native ordering. Values larger than the
  total number of pairs are silently capped at that total.

## Value

- If `output = "kable"`: an object of class `"RMlocdepGamma"`.
  Internally a list with two `knitr_kable` elements, `$direction1` and
  `$direction2`. In both, the rest score is the total score minus Item 2
  (the second column); the two elements list each item pair in the two
  possible orders, so together they cover both rest-score directions for
  every pair. Each has columns "Item 1", "Item 2", "Partial gamma",
  "Adj. p-value (BH)", and "p-value sign." (a star-string indicator from
  [`iarm::partgam_LD()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/iarm/man/partgam_LD.html)).
  When `cutoff` is provided, additional columns "Gamma low", "Gamma
  high", and "Flagged" are included.

  The object has custom [`print()`](https://rdrr.io/r/base/print.html)
  and
  [`knitr::knit_print()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/knitr/man/knit_print.html)
  methods: in the R console it prints the two tables stacked vertically;
  in a Quarto / R Markdown chunk it renders as two distinct pipe tables.
  Access the individual tables explicitly as `result$direction1` and
  `result$direction2` if needed.

- If `output = "dataframe"`: a named list of two data.frames
  (`$direction1`, `$direction2`) with columns `Item1`, `Item2`, `gamma`,
  `se`, `lower`, `upper` (95% Wald CI), `padj_bh`, `Significance`. When
  `cutoff` is provided, columns `gamma_low`, `gamma_high`, and `flagged`
  are also included. With `p_value = TRUE`, `padj_bh` and `Significance`
  are replaced by `p_gamma` and `padj_gamma` (identical for a pair in
  both directions).

## Details

Partial gamma (Christensen, Kreiner & Mesbah, 2013) measures the
residual association between pairs of items after controlling for the
rest score (total score minus one item). Because it matters which item
is subtracted, calculations are done for each pair in both directions,
yielding two data.frames.

Values near 0 indicate no local dependence. Large positive values
suggest positive LD (items share variance beyond the latent trait),
while large negative values suggest negative LD.

The `iarm` package must be installed (it is in Suggests, not Imports).

**Bootstrap p-values.** When `p_value = TRUE`, each pair's observed
partial gamma (canonical direction) is compared against its simulated
null distribution (from `cutoff$results`, simulated under local
independence). The per-pair statistic is the residual studentised by the
bootstrap mean and SD; the marginal p-value is the one-sided Monte-Carlo
p-value `(1 + #\{t* >= t\}) / (B + 1)` for excess *positive* LD
(redundancy, the diagnostic target — matching
[`RMlocdepQ3`](https://pgmj.github.io/easyRasch2/dev/reference/RMlocdepQ3.md)),
so it can be no smaller than `1 / (B + 1)`. The band still shows both
bounds for reference. `correction = "fwer"` uses the Westfall-Young
studentised-max step-down over the family of all pairs, which exploits
the bootstrap dependence among them (Ferreira, 2024); it is liberal when
the simulation is small, so at least 1000 `iterations` in
[`RMlocdepGammaCutoff()`](https://pgmj.github.io/easyRasch2/dev/reference/RMlocdepGammaCutoff.md)
are recommended (a warning is issued below that). Unlike the asymptotic
p-values from
[`iarm::partgam_LD()`](https://rdrr.io/pkg/iarm/man/partgam_LD.html),
these are calibrated against the *simulated Rasch null* rather than the
asymptotic SE; they are model-conditional and sample-size-sensitive, and
are reported alongside the simulated effect-size band, not in place of
it.

## Multiple comparisons

The marginal p-value controls the error rate of a *single* comparison:
for one item (or item pair) decided on in advance it is the relevant
value. But scanning all *k* comparisons and flagging whichever fall
below `alpha` tests *k* hypotheses at once, so the chance of at least
one false flag inflates to roughly \\1 - (1 - \alpha)^k\\ (e.g. about
34% for *k* = 8 at `alpha = 0.05`) – even when every marginal p-value is
correctly calibrated. The corrected (adjusted) p-value controls this:
`correction = "fwer"` bounds the probability of *any* false flag
(strict, lower power), while `"fdr_bh"` / `"fdr_by"` bound the expected
*proportion* of false flags among those raised (a more lenient middle
ground). Rule of thumb: use the marginal p-value for a single
pre-specified comparison, and a corrected p-value when screening the
whole table – the usual workflow.
